== ASSIGNMENT 5 README ==

This project either accepts an integer or two filenames from the user
  if an integer is given then it will create two random square matrices with rows and columns equal to the given integer
    in files named matrix1.txt and matrix2.txt
    then it will multiply the two matrices and paste them into a file named matrix3.txt
  if two filenames are given then it will assume the files are matrices able to be multiplied
    then multiply the two files and output the matrix in matrix3.txt
